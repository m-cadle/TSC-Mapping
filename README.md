# TSC-Mapping
Mapping of the Trust Services Criteria (TSC) to real world examples
For this project, I took a list of the Common Criteria (CC) from the AICPA's Trust Services Criteria and mapped them to real world examples, as the COSO principles they are derived from are not always descriptive enough to be clear. It is my hope that this resource will help someone in the understanding and development of their security posture.
